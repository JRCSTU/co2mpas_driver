Description: # The present work implements a lightweight microsimulation free-flow acceleration model (MFC) that is able to capture the vehicle acceleration dynamics accurately and consistently, it provides a link between the model and the driver and can be easily implemented and tested without raising the computational complexity. The proposed model has been developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.

        ##How to package new_MFC project for distribution
        <!--move them to CONTRIBUTING.md -->
        
        1. Register on PyPi: https://pypi.org/account/register/ or GitHub and upload 
            to make your package be accessible publicly.
        
        2. Check the required tools.
            It is important to make sure that pip, setuptools, and wheel are up to date      
            
                python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
                
        3. Setup your project.
            create a setup.py file in your project root directory. This file will contain
            all of the packages metadata information. In the project folder we have
            a package with an __init__.py file that plots the work flow of the whole 
            project. we have also the README.md and LICENSE.txt for the licence of the
            project.
            
            The project folder structure looks like:

                â””â”€â”€â”€__pycache__
        
        4. Compile your package
           Change your directory into the root of the project and execute the command below
           depending on the system environment.
           
           1. Source distribution
           
                This only provides a meta data and the essential source files needed 
                to build an installable format. This can be generated by:
                
                    python setup.py sdist
           
           2. Built distribution
