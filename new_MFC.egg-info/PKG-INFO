Description: # The present work implements a lightweight microsimulation free-flow acceleration model (MFC) that is able to capture the vehicle acceleration dynamics accurately and consistently, it provides a link between the model and the driver and can be easily implemented and tested without raising the computational complexity. The proposed model has been developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.
